Third party elements
--
This repository is still somewhat disorganised, and includes some third party code. This includes (but may not be limited to), code generated by the [STM32 Cube IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) default project generator; [tinyusb](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb); [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (which in turn uses [gl3w](https://github.com/skaslev/gl3w) and [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)), [portaudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio). These projects remain under their original licenses.

Derived works & Commercial Products
--
If you make something with this, I'd love to know! Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mmalex) 

If you sell or distribute something based on plinky, please make it clear that it is distinct from the original plinky design, and abide by the licenses above.
My main concern is that the small plinky community, who are focused on discussion of creative audio hardware in general, become burdened with support or other work for a product they didn't actively get involved with. We don't want that! So please be respectful.
