# plinky
touch synth
so tinrs persuaded me to opensource this
I apologise, its been so long since I looked at this, I am releasing this as somewhat abandonware.
please if you make a plinky derived thing, let me know on twitter @mmalex, and if you sell it, please don't use the plinky name directly and make it clear that it is not an original plinky in any way.

this includes software and hardware files, I have no idea how to build it any more :) you need STM32 cube ide, its basically the default project so most of the code is in sw/Core/Src, most of the rest of the sw/ folder is just the usual auto generated boilerplate mess.

it should also compile as an emulator for mac and gui, using portaudio and dear imgui. it also compiles for wasm, somehow :)

there is also a bootloader project...

the hardware is mostly in the hw/ folder, but I was new to kicad so I am not sure if all the library stuff is in the right place.

if there is something missing or something in there that you think shouldn't be in there, let me know and I can sort it out

many thanks for all the support of plinky over the years.
I hope cool things can be made with this!

im submitting this before my brain kicks in and persuades me not to :)
